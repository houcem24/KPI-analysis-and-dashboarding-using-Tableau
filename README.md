KPI Analysis and Dashboarding Using Tableau

A project to perform Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis and build dashboards using Tableau to visualize and explore business metrics.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
File	Purpose
KPI data.xlsx	The source data used for analysis / dashboarding.
Dashboarding.twb	The Tableau workbook file, containing dashboard(s) built on the KPI data.
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

Define and compute relevant KPIs from raw data in KPI data.xlsx.

Use Tableau to build visual dashboards for monitoring KPI trends, spotting issues or opportunities.

Enable non-technical stakeholders to interact with the data via dashboards, making insights accessible.

ðŸ›  How to Use

Prerequisites

Tableau Desktop (or another version capable of opening .twb files)

Access to the data file (KPI data.xlsx)

Steps to explore / modify

Open KPI data.xlsx to review and understand the data (column fields, format, metrics).

Launch Tableau and open Dashboarding.twb.

Inspect the dashboards: see which KPIs are included, what filters are available, etc.

Modify, add, or filter visualizations as needed: you can add new sheets, adjust charts, change formatting, etc.

Potential extensions

Automate data refresh (if data updates regularly).

Publish dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Public for sharing.

Add interactivity (filters, drill-downs, tooltips) if not already included.

âœ… Possible KPIs & Insights

Some of the kinds of metrics you can (or do) monitor in dashboards like this:

Trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly) of key measures (sales, revenues, costs, data quality, etc.)

Comparison between actual vs target values

Breakdown by categories (region, department, product line, etc.)

Identification of anomalies or outliers (e.g., dips, spikes)

Contribution of different components / categories to overall performance
